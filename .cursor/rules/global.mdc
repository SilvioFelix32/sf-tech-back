## Purpose
This file serves as a **central context source** for AI-assisted development.  
It helps the AI understand:
- Project architecture and goals
- Code style and conventions
- Functional and technical boundaries
- Documentation and improvement workflows

Use this file as a **reference anchor** for all `.mdc` rule sets.

## AI Behavior Rules
- Always reference this file (`global.mdc`) as the **primary context** before generating code, documentation, or analysis.
- Prioritize **clarity, maintainability, and consistency** with project conventions defined in `/rules/*.mdc`.
- When unsure about implementation details, **refer to existing project patterns** (e.g., folder structure, naming, DAL conventions).
- Use **TypeScript** as the default language unless stated otherwise..
- Prefer concise and professional English when generating documentation or comments.

# Global Rules (global.mdc)

- **Always** - use the MCP context7 - for DOCs consults

Central file that references and aggregates all `.mdc` rules in the project.  
Keep the original files in `/rules` and `/.cursor/rules`. Use this file as the single source of truth.

## Referenced Files
- `./rules/rules.mdc` — Details the project structure, App Router, DAL design, and component best practices.
- `./tech-stack.mdc` - Details package 
- `./rules/self-improvement.mdc` — Contains AI self-optimization and evolution rules for improving context understanding and responses.
- `./.cursor/rules/cursor-rules.mdc` — Explains how to create, edit, and organize `.mdc` rule files for the Cursor environment.
- `./.cursor/rules/logger.mdc` — Defines logging patterns and standards using the Logger class.

## Quick Links
[rules.mdc](./rules/rules.mdc)  
[tech-stach.mdc](./tech-stack.mdc)
[cursor-rules.mdc](./.cursor/rules/cursor-rules.mdc)
[self-improvement.mdc](./self-improvement.mdc)
[logger.mdc](./.cursor/rules/logger.mdc)

## Operational Notes
- If Cursor cannot automatically resolve local links, run the aggregation script to generate `./rules/global.mdc` with all referenced content.
- Avoid including `global.mdc` in the concatenation process to prevent recursive loops.
- Regularly review `self-improvement.mdc` for AI behavior updates and improvements.
